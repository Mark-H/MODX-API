# Introduction

These documents contain an OpenAPI 3.0 specification for a RESTful API for MODX Revolution. The goal is to define a structure and output format first, and to then start working on an implementation of the spec as an open source extra. 

## Why a RESTful API?

In the MODX manager, a lot of AJAX requests are already used for retrieving information from the database, as well as creating and updating said data (to developers known as the connector/processors). 

The problem with this API is that it is very much built to the way the manager works. Rather than providing a way to interact with objects, processors are mapped to functionality. If a function for a specific object doesn't exist yet in the MODX manager, new processors need to be developed for that function. 

By following standards for APIs that exist outside the MODX Community, we can make it easier to experiment with and build a new version of the MODX manager. The API would not be tied to actions, but to objects (or resources). 

While eventually this API will hopefully be build and launched as an open source extra for MODX, the actual code that is used to build it is also easier to adjust in the future as its external interaction would be documented. 

## Goals and Wishes

The primary goal is to define a specification for the external API, which maps to the current minor version of MODX. When that's available, the next goal is to build an open source MODX Extra that complies with the specification. 

When all that is done, the hope is that eventually this project will be adopted in one form or the other into the MODX core and third party extras. 

This project should make use of existing standards, specifications and libraries where possible.

- Apiary: https://apiary.io/

While the goal is to match the current version of MODX, there is some freedom to correct inconsistencies in the core in a progressive fashion. For example standardizing data formats API-wide, and excluding legacy database fields that are not actively used. Where the API spec/implementation differs from the standard MODX, this needs to be clearly documented including the reasoning for the change.
