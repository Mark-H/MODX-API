# Authentication

The MODX API will support several methods of authentication for different purposes. Implementations may offer additional, non-spec, authentication methods on top of the authentication in this document. 

## Cookie / Session Authentication

The default authentication for the MODX API uses the standard MODX authentication through a user session and/or cookie. In this type of authentication, a user session is required and permissions are loaded from that session.

Cookie / Session authentication is limited to client-side integrations (e.g. JavaScript/AJAX requests from within the site or manager) and are limited to the same origin as MODX. In other scenarios, Session Authentication may not be possible.

## Basic Authentication

Basic Authentication may be used with a username and API Key specific to the user account. This is provided through the Authentication header.
